The purpose of the programm is to organize some repeatedly job's.
Such as sending message (now) or saving some generated file(need to release).
This python program allows us to send a mail with included files.
Now, this program calculate the current date and include to mail
file which contain yesterday's date. (Report about last day).
It's can send mail to diff recipients and CC recipients.
But this program not universal now, it's for my use.
Program alow to use some open smtp sever.
Tested on python 3.2.
Not work on python < 3 because module email and configparser change
its syntax.
Module xmlparse convert xls file to txt (manualy, worked only on 
python2.7 and older). To use it type "python modules/xmlparse.py DAY"
DAY - this is a day with which we need to search xls file.
