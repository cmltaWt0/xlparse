Program contains of two part. First is xlparse.py that have GUI 
interface and give ability to choise xls file to transform it to 
txt file by prepared algoritm. tmp dir contain tmf result file. 
Second part is planner.py which use send_mail.py module to send
mail with some included file (transformed by xlparse, can organize
sending by cron).
Now, planner calculate the current date and include to mail
file which contain yesterday's date. (Report about last day).
It's can send mail to diff recipients and CC recipients.
But this program not universal now, it's for my use.
Program alow to use some open smtp sever.
Not work on python >=3, only on python <=2.7  because module email and configparser change
its syntax.
Xlparse tested on python <=2.7 because xlrd module not allowed for
python3 now.
